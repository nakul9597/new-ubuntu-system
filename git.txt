	git config --global color.ui true
	git config --global user.name "YOUR NAME"
	git config --global user.email "YOUR@EMAIL.com"
	ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "YOUR@EMAIL.com"

The next step is to take the newly generated SSH key and add it to your Github account. You want to copy and paste the output of the following command and paste it @ your https://github.com/settings/keys

	cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

//Once you've done this, you can check and see if it worked:

	ssh -T git@github.com

//connection yes
